# EarthquakesLM

Use this Shiny App to build a linear model based on the included earthquakes.csv dataset. The application user can select the column in the spreadsheet that will be the response term, and a subset of the remaining terms that will form the design matrix. The application has been tested on Rstudion on the desktop, and also on the shiny server. 

To train a linear model on a different dataset, include the dataset and update global.R to point to the new dataset.
